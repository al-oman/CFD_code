This code is for solving LaPlace's heat equation in 2D, as an assignment for AERO 455 (Computational Fluid Dynamics)

The steady state heat temperatures at eaach point in the grid is calculated for 2 different resolutions using 
2 different techniques each. One is by plugging in hand calculated solutions to the LaPlace equations, and the
other is the use of numerical techniques for comparison.
